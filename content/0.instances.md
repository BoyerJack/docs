# Instances

This page showcases movie-web instances hosted by the community and other alternative sites. If you want to add your instance to this list, please open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/movie-web/docs).

## Official Instances

These instances are maintained by the community and are considered "official", meaning they are likely to be up-to-date. Keep in mind, that since these are volunteer instances, they might be down or stop working entirely at any time. Some of these may not include a custom backend, so data syncing across devices might not be possible. If you want to be sure you have access to movie-web, you should consider [hosting your own instance.](../1.self-hosting/1.hosting-intro.md).

## Alternatives

These sites are not related to movie-web but are good enough to switch to if the official instances are down. You can also use [FMHY](https://fmhy.pages.dev/videopiracyguide) to find even more options.
