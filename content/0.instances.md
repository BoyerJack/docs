# Instances

This page showcases movie-web instances hosted by the community and other alternative sites. If you want to add your instance to this list, please open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/movie-web/docs).

## Official Instances

These instances are maintained by the community and are considered "official", meaning they are likely to be up-to-date. Keep in mind, that since these are volunteer instances, they might be down or stop working entirely at any time. If you want to be sure you have access to movie-web, you should consider [hosting your own instance](../1.self-hosting/1.hosting-intro.md). 

<b>Instances marked with a ðŸ’¾ have set up a backend, making it possible to sync your data across multiple devices.</b>

## Alternatives

These sites are not related to movie-web but are good enough to switch to if the official instances are down. You can also use [FMHY](https://fmhy.pages.dev/videopiracyguide) to find even more options.
