# Introduction to the proxy

Our proxy is used to bypass CORS-protected URLs on the client side, allowing users to make requests to CORS protected endpoints without a backend server.

Our recommended provider is Netlify due to its [generous free plan](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/#core-pricing-table).
