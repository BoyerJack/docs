# Deploying the client

## Method 1 - Vercel - Recommended

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmovie-web%2Fmovie-web%2Ftree%2Fmaster&env=VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL,VITE_TMDB_READ_API_KEY)

1. Click the Deploy button.
1. Sign in using either a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
1. Follow the instructions to create a repository for movie-web.
1. Configure the environment variables:

   - `VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL`: Enter your proxy URL here. Make sure to not have a slash at the end of your URL.

     Example (THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, IT WON'T WORK FOR YOU): `https://test-proxy.test.workers.dev`

   - `VITE_TMDB_READ_API_KEY`: Enter your TMDB Read Access Token here. Please read [the TMDB page](./tmdb.mdx) on how to get an API key.

   - `VITE_BACKEND_URL`: Only set if you have a self-hosted backend. Put in your backend URL. Check out [configuration reference](../client/configuration.mdx) for details. Make sure to not have a slash at the end of the URL.

1. Click "Deploy"
1. Click [here](https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web/fork) to fork the movie-web Github repository
1. Go to Project settings/Git.
1. Disconnect your project's Connected Git Repository.
1. Click the Github button.
1. Connect your own fork of the movie-web Github repository.
1. Congrats! You have your own version of movie-web hosted.
1. You may wish to configure a custom domain - Please consult [the Vercel docs for how to do this](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/domains).

## Method 2 - Static Web Host

1. Download the file `movie-web.zip` from the latest release: https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web/releases/latest.
2. Extract the ZIP file so you can edit the files.
3. Open `config.js` in an editor such as Notepad, Visual Studio Code or similar.
4. Put your proxy URL in-between the double quotes of `VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL: ""`. Make sure to not have a slash at the end of your URL.

   Example (THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, IT WON'T WORK FOR YOU): `VITE_CORS_PROXY_URL: "https://test-proxy.test.workers.dev"`

5. Put your TMDB Read Access Token inside the quotes of `VITE_TMDB_READ_API_KEY: ""`. Please read [the TMDB page](./tmdb.mdx) on how to get an API key.
6. If you have a self-hosted backend server, enter your URL in the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` variable. Check out [configuration reference](../client/configuration.mdx) for details. Make sure to not have a slash at the end of the URL.
7. Save the file.
8. Upload **all** of the files to a static website hosting such as:
   - GitHub Pages
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - Etc, [there are lots of options](https://www.staticwebsitehosting.org/).
9. Congrats! You have your own version of movie-web hosted.

## Method 3 - Docker Compose - Home Network

This method is meant for those using a desktop device or single board computer with a minimum of 4GB of RAM such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) to run movie-web on there home network for network connected devices.

1. Ensure you have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. In a newly created directory called `movie-web` create a file called `docker-compose.yaml`. Paste the contents of the code block below into this file.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:

  movieweb:
    build:
      context: https://github.com/movie-web/movie-web.git
      # args:
      #   TMDB_READ_API_KEY: ""
      #   CORS_PROXY_URL: ""
      #   BACKEND_URL: ""
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. Within the `docker-compose.yaml` file uncomment `args`, `TMDB_READ_API_KEY`, `CORS_PROXY_URL`. 
- Make sure `args` is in-line with `context` 
- Make sure `TMDB_READ_API_KEY` and `CORS_PROXY_URL` are tabbed once to the right of `args`.
3. Put your proxy URL in-between the double quotes of `CORS_PROXY_URL: ""`. Make sure to not have a slash at the end of your URL. 

   Example (THIS IS AN EXAMPLE, IT WON'T WORK FOR YOU): `CORS_PROXY_URL: "https://test-proxy.test.workers.dev"`

4. Put your TMDB Read Access Token inside the quotes of `TMDB_READ_API_KEY: ""`. Please read [the TMDB page](./tmdb.mdx) on how to get an API key.
5. Uncomment and add any [additional environment variables](configuration.mdx) you may need. Remove the `VITE_` prefix when adding an environment variable to `args`.
6. Save the file!
7. Now use [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to run `movieweb` as background service.

```bash
# movie-web is the current working directory
$ docker compose up --detach
```

8. Verify that setup was successful
- Navigate to `http://localhost`. You should see the UI for `movie-web`. Find something to watch and make sure that it plays. 
- View logs with

   ```bash
   $ docker compose logs --follow movieweb
   ```

9. Set a static IP address for your device.

- For Mac: [guide](https://www.macinstruct.com/tutorials/how-to-set-a-static-ip-address-on-a-mac/)
- For Windows: [guide](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-set-up-a-static-ip-address)

10. Navigate to movie web at `http://<static-ip-address` from another device connected to your network.

### To Perform Updates For New Releases of Movie Web

1. Make sure `movie-web` is your current working directory and run:

```bash
# Re-build the image and start the container
$ docker compose up --build --detach
```
